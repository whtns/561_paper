# Abstract

* Enhancers regulate spatiotemp gene expression. 

* enhancers require tf binding and histone modification

* how much is unclear.

* bomcine Chip with parallel reporter assay to id functional enhancers in ESCs.

* Active enhancers associate wiht TF but only a minority of NANOG, OCT4, H3K27ac, and H3K4me1 marked regions function as enhancers

* Activity changes under naive versus primed culture conditions

* Can identify an enhancer set associated with non-ESC-specific processes.

* Transposable elements may associate with enhancers, but only some exhibit activity. 

* Within super-enhancers large tracts are nonfunctional, restricted to small subdomains. 

*
