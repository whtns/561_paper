# loven

* Chromatin regulators are targets for cancer therapy

* Why does inhibition of chrematin regulatros have gene-specific effects in tumor cells?

* How can inhibition of BRD4 lead to selective inhibiiont of myc in multiple myeloma (MM)?

* BRD4 and mediator co-occupy 1e3 enhancers associated with active genes. 

* BRD4 and Mediator co-occupy a few very large super-enhancers associated with MYC and other genes.

* Treatment with JQ1 (BED-bromodomain inhibitor) leads to loss of BRD4 at super-enhancers and transcription elongation defects at super-enhancer genes.
