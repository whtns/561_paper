# Summary
* posttrans histone mod change regulation but prop and heritable gene expression state are contr.

* Chomatin in vivo assay (CiA) emplyes chemically induced proximity ot initate and terminate chromatin mod to living cells. 

* recruit HP1a to induce H3K9me3 gene silencing. Describe kinetics and amoutn of chrom mod at Oct4 in cells

* H3K9me3 prop symmet at rates to produce domains of ~10kb. when remove HP1a heterochrom domains heritably transmittedd thorugh mult. cell generations.

* quant. model of kinetics reveals competition between histone mark and turnover. and determines boundaries and stability of H3K9me3 domains. 

* is widely applicable.
