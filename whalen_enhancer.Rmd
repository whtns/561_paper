* Discrimsinating gene targets of distal regulatory elements from other nearby transcribed genes might relate to diseases

* _Targetfinder_ is a computational method to reconstruct regulatory landscapes.

* generates models to predict individual e-p intrxn across cell lines

* uncover interactions structural proteins, tfs, epi mods, transcription, all distinguish interacting e-p pairs. Most is not proximal but instead relates to looping DNA. 

# Correction by Xi and Beer

* many e-ps share features, cross-fold validation by whalen is subject to overfitting. corrected models predict EP interactions with much lower accuracy.
